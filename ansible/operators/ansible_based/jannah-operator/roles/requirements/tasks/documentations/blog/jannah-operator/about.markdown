Jannah.io is a lab for developing cloud native software solutions.

Jannah.io itself, is implemented as a software application.  Software applications developed
on the Jannah platform would be somewhat feature clones of Jannah itself.

This  kubernetes operator is tooling to manage end to end
lifecycle management of Jannah infrastructure including public, and
private clouds.
