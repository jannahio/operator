   The series will include videos, blogs, and other social media postings.


2) We need two main 'vehicles' to facilitate our journey.
    - Jannah Accelerator Platform:
        - A tool to groom software ideas into fully monetized products (apps).
    - Jannah Operator.
        - An end-to-end Operator to deploy Jannah infrastructure on a Kubernetes cluster.


3) In this video I will use the end-2-end operator to deploy Jannah components into a local Kubernetes cluster.
    - Deploy Jannah dependency services.
        - Kubleflow (Machine Learning services)
        - Postgres Database
    - Deploy Jannah
        - Jannah Middleware
        - Jannah UI
    - Make command
      - make jannah-config 
      - make charm-converge
